<p id="description">Overview This project is a simple encryption/decryption tool developed in C++. It provides users with the ability to encrypt or decrypt numerical data using two different methods: substitution cipher and ROT13 cipher.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   User Choice: Users can choose between encryption and decryption operations.
*   Input: Users are prompted to enter the numerical data they want to encrypt or decrypt.
*   Encryption/Decryption: Based on the user's choice the program performs the encryption or decryption operation using either substitution cipher or ROT13 cipher.
*   Output: The result of the encryption or decryption operation is displayed to the user.
